#Twitter trends app
## Introduction
This application operates as a Java web server using Spring framework, and its main purpose is to view and analyze past
and current Twitter trends (provided by this [API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/trends/locations-with-trending-topics/api-reference/get-trends-available)).

The user can interrogate the server by using a simple frontend or by calling the rest APIs directly.

Once the server is started, it will periodically save the daily trends in a json file, thus providing an archive of past 
daily trends to the user.

The frontend design is very simple and barebone, without compromising on functionalities and ease of use.

It's built using HTML and CSS as the view part, Thymeleaf as a very simple controller and the Spring server as the backend.
